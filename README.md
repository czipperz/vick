**VICK IS NOWHERE NEAR READY FOR USAGE.  AS OF NOW IT DOESN'T EVEN
  EDIT TEXT!!**

Vick is a `VI` based editor that focuses on configuration.  To be able
to configure Vick you must be able to compile from source Vick.  So
here's how to compile it from source:

    git clone https://github.com/czipperz/vick vick
    cd vick
    make test     # will make and do tests
